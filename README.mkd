# erlang-alternate.vim

Switch between source and test files with `:A`-command in Erlang projects.

## Usage

* `:A` - switches from source to corresponding test file(or vise versa)
* `:AS` - splits and switches
* `:AV` - vertical splits and switches
* `:AT` - new tab and switches

## Limitations

Currently, only standard Erlang directory convention is supported:

* sources are located in `src/`
* test files are located in `test/`
* test file should be suffixed with `_tests.erl`

Example: `src/hook.erl` is alternated to `test/hook_tests.erl`
