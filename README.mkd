# erlang-alternate.vim

Switch between source and test files with `:A`-command in Erlang projects.

## Usage

* `:A` - switches from source to corresponding test file(or vise versa)
* `:AS` - splits and switches
* `:AV` - vertical splits and switches
* `:AT` - new tab and switches

## Limitations

Currently, only `EUnit` and `wooga/etest` directory conventions are supported:

* sources are located in `src/`
* test files are located in `test/`
* test file should be suffixed with `_tests.erl`(EUnit) or with
  `_test.erl`(etest)

Example: `src/hook.erl` is alternated to `test/hook_tests.erl` or to
`test/hook_test.erl`.

## Installation

- [Pathogen][1] `git clone https://github.com/cris/erlang-alternate.vim ~/.vim/bundle/erlang-alternate.vim`
- [Vundle][2] `Bundle 'cris/erlang-alternate.vim'`
- [NeoBundle][3] `NeoBundle 'cris/erlang-alternate.vim'`

## Ideas

* Switch to header file as in `a.vim` (not sure whether it's valuable)
